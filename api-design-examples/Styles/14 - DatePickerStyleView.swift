         the component, especially if we want to style the
         compact version of it.
         so we have to be a little bit hacky

         Note: you can of course use the properties as you want
         and come up with another style without any of the hacks i have here,
         but i was stubborn üòÖ enough that i wanted to change the
         `.compact` version of the style to look a certain way.
